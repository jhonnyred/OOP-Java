# INHERITANCE_2

This project is a hypothetical class arrangement for a company, featuring four personas: Employee, Manager, Salesperson, and Client.  
The classes and their respective attributes are:

- **Person** (superclass):  
  - name  
  - cpf  
  - birthDate  

  **METHODS**:  
  - `formatLocal(String date)`  
    Converts a String to LocalDate  
  - `formatStr(LocalDate date)`  
    Converts a LocalDate to String  
  - `printAll()`  
    Returns a String with all attributes  

- **Client** (subclass of Person):  
  - email  
  - phone  
  - loyaltyPoints  

- **Employee** (subclass of Person):  
  - hiringDate  
  - salary  

- **Manager** (subclass of Employee):  
  - department  

- **Salesperson** (subclass of Employee):  
  - commission  

All classes have their respective getters and setters, and the method `printAll()` is overridden from the Person class.
