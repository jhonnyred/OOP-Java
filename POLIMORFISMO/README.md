# POLYMORPHISM

The project consists of classes made to explore polymorphism in a simple way.  
There are 3 classes: **Person** (abstract superclass), **Professor** (concrete subclass), and **Student** (concrete subclass), with the following attributes:

- **Person** (abstract superclass)  
  - name  
  - institution  
  - email  
  - age  

- **Professor** (concrete subclass)  
  - subject  

- **Student** (concrete subclass)  
  - year  

The **Person** class has the super method `generateEmail()`, responsible for generating the email if it is not provided in the constructors.  
All classes have the method `greetings()`, with their respective variations for each subclass.

### 📋 Requirements

You must have Java installed and all required dependencies.  
(If you're on Linux, make sure to install `jdk-23_linux-x64_bin.deb`)

### 🔧 Installation

To run the project, you can use **Visual Studio Code** or run it directly from a Linux shell using the `java` command.  
To do this, first compile the files with:

```bash
javac Main.java
```
